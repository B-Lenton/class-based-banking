# Class-based Bank Account Project

##### A short Python program written as part of [a Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/)

This program does not have the functionality of connecting to a database or any server-side code; it was used to practice key Object-Oriented programming techniques:

- Writing classes
- Instantiating classes
- Properties and methods (including dunder methods)
- Error and exception handling
- Writing information to files

Also covered in this section of the course, but not showcased in this small project, was:
